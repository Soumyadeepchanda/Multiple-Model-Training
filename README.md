# Multiple Models Training on the Google Play Store Dataset
This project aims to train multiple models on the Google Play Store dataset to predict various app attributes and categories. The dataset contains information about different apps available on the Google Play Store, including app names, categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Google Play Store dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link: [Google Play Store Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps)<br>

### The dataset consists of the following columns:<br>

App: Name of the app<br>
Category: Category of the app<br>
Rating: Average user rating of the app<br>
Reviews: Number of user reviews for the app<br>
Size: Size of the app<br>
Installs: Number of app installations<br>
Type: Paid or Free<br>
Price: Price of the app (if it is a paid app)<br>
Content Rating: Content rating for the app<br>
Genres: Genres under which the app falls<br>
Last Updated: Date when the app was last updated<br>
Current Ver: Current version of the app<br>
Android Ver: Minimum Android version required to run the app<br>

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, it's essential to preprocess the dataset. This step involves handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. You can refer to the notebook or script that accompanies this README for the specific data preprocessing steps.

## Choose Multiple Models
Select the machine learning or deep learning models you want to train on the Google Play Store dataset. Some popular models for regression or classification tasks include:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Depending on your task (regression or classification) and preference, you can choose one or more models to train.

## Feature Engineering
If required, perform feature engineering on the dataset. This step involves selecting relevant features, creating new features, or transforming existing features to improve the model's performance. Feature engineering techniques include one-hot encoding, feature scaling, feature extraction, and more.

## Model Training
Train the selected models using the preprocessed dataset. Use appropriate model training techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization to optimize the model's performance. Evaluate the models using suitable evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE), accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

## Model Comparison
Compare the performance of the trained models using the evaluation metrics.
